# Behat Contexts


Contexts that we use with Behat 3.x tests on Drupal sites.

This repository is based on [Nuvole drupal extension](https://github.com/nuvoleweb/drupal-behat).

## Install

Install with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org):

1) Add these lines in "repositories" entry of your composer.json:

```json
{
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://github.com/mistermoper/drupal-behat"
}
```

2) Require package with composer require:

`composer require metadrop/behat-contexts`


## Configure

Each context may have its own configuration. [Here is an example](https://github.com/Metadrop/behat-contexts/blob/dev/behat.yml.dist) with all the contexts added.

## Contexts

### Cache context

Steps to clear caches.

#### Steps

- Given :path page cache is flushed
  Clear specific page caches.

- Given :view view data cache is flushed
  Clear caches for a specific view. Only available for Drupal 7, pending to implement in D8. 

### Content authored context

Allow created content owned by logged in user.

#### Steps

   Run search api cron. Only for D7.

 - Given I run the cron of Search API Solr
   Run search api solr cron. Only for D7.


### DebugContext

Simple context to help debugging tests with some steps. Additionally, it hooks in the after step event to add a step that generates an error report on failed steps.

This report includes:
  - A file with the HTML page content.
  - A file with the current URL and the error exception dump.
  - If available, a file with current page state.


#### Steps

- Then capture full page with a width of :width

  Saves a screenshot of current page with the given width to a file.

- Then capture full page with a width of :width with name :filename in configured directory (screenshots_path).

  Saves a screenshot of current page with the given width to a given filename in configured directory (screenshots_path).

- Then capture full page with width of :width to :path

  Saves a screenshot of current page with the given width to a file in the given path. If path is relative screenshots_path config value is used as root.

- Then capture full page with width of :width to :path with name :filename

  Saves a screenshot of current page with the given width to a file in the given path to a given filename. If path is relative screenshots_path config value is used as root.

- Then save last response

  Saves page content to a file.

- Then save last response to :path

  Saves page content to a file in the given path.

- Then save last response to :path

  Halts test for a given amount of seconds. Useful when debugging tests with timing issues. Don't use this step in real tests.


#### Configuration
  Add DebugContext to your suite.

  This is an example when bootstrap directorty is in DRUPALROOT/sites/all/tests/behat/bootstrap.

```
default:
  autoload:
    ...
  suites:
    default:
      ...
      contexts:
        - Metadrop\Behat\Context\DebugContext:
            parameters:
              'report_on_error': true
              'error_reporting_url': 'https://example.com/sites/default/files/behat/errors'
              'error_reporting_path': '/var/www/html/docroot/sites/default/files/behat/errors'
